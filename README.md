Project Introduction

This project aims to address the challenges of analyzing logs within a cloud computing framework, specifically focusing on DevOps and operational tasks. Users can download specific log files from their virtual machines and utilize this project to analyze these logs, identify issues, and troubleshoot problems effectively.

The project is designed to support various plugins, allowing users to easily integrate and expand functionality. As long as the necessary plugin is available, users can enhance the system, fostering a collaborative environment for module development. Currently, I am working on a module for analyzing Linux logs, which will be more versatile than traditional vmagent logs. The goal is to create a tool that everyone can contribute to, enabling us to extend its capabilities to analyze logs from other services, such as AKS.

This initiative not only simplifies log analysis but also encourages community involvement, making it a valuable resource for users seeking to improve their operational efficiency.
